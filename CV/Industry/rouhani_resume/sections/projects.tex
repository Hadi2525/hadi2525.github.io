	\subsection{Simulator for Queueing systems [\href{https://github.com/Hadi2525/queueing_theory}{Python Code}]}
	\subtext{Computer Networks \& Performance}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item I developed an algorithm using various data structures including doubly linked lists, tensors, hash tables to model a queueing system
		\item An object-oriented programming API was developed to represent users and servers.
		\item I improved the coding so that it would have the best time complexity 
	\end{zitemize}

	\subsection{Applied Machine Learning Projects}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item Predict the salary of a company given some features in a real dataset using regression models from \texttt{sklearn} library.
		\item Develop an API to train a machine learning model to predict the job positions of a company based on available features in their dataset using decision tree regression model from \texttt{sklearn Python}.
	\end{zitemize}

	\subsection{Programming in Linux }
	\subtext{Operating Systems Concept}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item Developed a C programming code that shows the virtual memory allocation of a running process in Linux. [\href{https://github.com/Hadi2525/vmemory_maps}{C Code}]
		\item I wrote a C code to model the TCP communication between a server and several clients. This communication achieved via local and external IP addresses.
		\item Working with \texttt{Valgrind} in C/Linux.
	\end{zitemize}
