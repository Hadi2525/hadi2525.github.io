	\subsection{Reddit Clone Web Application}
	\subtext{Web Application with Angular}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item Developed an application that allows users to post an article and a system is available for upvoting/downvoting
		\item The code follows ES6 developed using TypeScript
	\end{zitemize}

	\subsection{Breast cancer diagnosis using Machine Learning}
	\subtext{Supervised Machine Learning using classification methods from Scikit-learn python}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item Implemented 7 different classification ML models to compare diagnostic accuracy.
	\end{zitemize}	
	\subsection{Applied ML using real data}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item Predict the salary of a company given some features in a real dataset using regression models from scikit-learn library.
		\item Develop an API to train a machine learning model to predict the job positions of a company based on available features in their dataset using decision tree regression model from scikit-learn Python.
	\end{zitemize}

	\subsection{C Coding in Linux}
	\subtext{Operating Systems}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item Developed a C programming code that shows the virtual memory allocation of a running process in Linux. [\href{https://github.com/Hadi2525/vmemory_maps}{C Code}]
		\item I wrote a C code to model the TCP communication between a server and several clients. This communication achieved via local and external IP addresses.
		\item Working with Valgrind in C/Linux.
	\end{zitemize}

	\subsection{Simulator for Queueing systems [\href{https://github.com/Hadi2525/queueing_theory}{Python Code}]}
	\subtext{Computer Networks \& Performance}
	\begin{zitemize}
		\item I developed an algorithm using various data structures including doubly linked lists, tensors, hash tables to model a queueing system
		\item An object-oriented programming API was developed to represent users and servers.
		\item I improved the coding so that it would have the best time complexity 
	\end{zitemize}
