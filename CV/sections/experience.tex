\section{Work Experience}
\subsection{{Machine Learning Researcher \hfill Sep 2020 --- Present}}
\subtext{Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta \hfill Edmonton, Alberta}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed an API to solve optimization problems with \texttt{cvxpy, cvxopt python} for sizing of charging stations co-located with renewable energy resources. Real data is used as training data to evaluate the charging system modeling. Machine learning tools (\texttt{scipy, sklearn, pandas}) are used to extract queueing system metrics by learning from  the data.\\
supervisors: \textbf{Dr. Omid Ardakanian} and \textbf{Dr. Petr Musilek}
\item Analyzing differential privacy in Machine learning methods for smart meters. A team-led by me worked on a machine learning API for home smart meters to evaluate differential privacy mechanism.\\
supervisor: \textbf{Dr. Nidhi Hegde}

\item Led a team-based project for APIC Hackathon competion where an API was developed in \texttt{python} to detect rooftop from Google Maps using computer vision tools and recommend the best sizing requirement for installation of solar panel. The team worked interactively through \texttt{git}.

\item As a lab instructor, I developed an API in \texttt{python} to identify the anomaly in student's performance based on their experiment results and reports. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{Teaching Assistant\hfill Sep 2020 --- Dec 2020}}
\subtext{Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta \hfill Edmonton, Alberta}
\begin{zitemize}
	\item Worked collaboratively with a team of TAs to arrange the content of a 2nd-year undergraduate course on \texttt{python}.
	\item Provided solutions to the assignments and marked over 200 python coding assignments using automations (i.e \texttt{makefile}, using \texttt{python} API, bash command line etc.)
	\item Provided daily reports through \texttt{git}.
\end{zitemize}

% EXPERIENCE B
%====================
\subsection{{Data Science Researcher \hfill Dec 2019 --- Jun 2020}}
\subtext{Universit√§t Stuttgart \hfill Stuttgart, Germany}
\begin{zitemize}
\item I Led three data science and probability theory projects on implementation of novel density estimation in power system analysis and using machine learning algorithms evaluate the feasibility of electric vehicle-to-grid power transaction.
\item Supervised two computer science master students with their projects on smart energy systems.
\end{zitemize}

% EXPERIENCE C
%====================
\subsection{{Test Tech Lead \hfill Jul 2019 --- Nov 2019}}
\subtext{Surplec HV \hfill Spruce Grove, Alberta}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Led the Test Department to detect faults and short circuits in transformers using experiment data.
\item Organized the testing environment in the department and made a structured data acquisition to capture/record/reuse the experiment data.
\item I developed an API in MS Excel to verify that running experiments on transformers follow all standards.
\end{zitemize}
